# What I Made

-I decided to use react to create a clock showing the current date that has a motivational quote below it.

- Everyone needs a little motivation sometimes
- The clock is similar in design to a digital clock.
- The motivational quotes contains the author's name and their direct quote.
- Clicking on the button generates a new quote.
- The button has a hover effect to show you are over the clickable area and when clicked it adds a light overlay to show you clicked it.
- The app is fully responsive changing font size and area size according to the device.
- I added the tsParticles background to add a cool moving background that is interactive.
- Plus i think this library is absolutely amazing!

# Biggest Takeaway From this Project

- as with most getting the hang of react, I used this project to really keep up my skill level with managing state.
- state is actually making more sense now since understanding that the state is just what the user sees at face value or in the interface.
- I am ver pleased with this project and the overall look with the balance of a moving background, an updating clock and a quote generator that the user controls.
